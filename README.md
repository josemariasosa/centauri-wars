## History

We are in the remote future now. The sun had problems somewhere in the timeline, and we all humans moved to the Tau Ceti star system. The Procyons destroyed the earth by messing with the sun. Some ships escaped, I was the Captain of the Alpha-Centauri ship.

Flying machines are beautiful, but only when you're outside of them, when your are at home. But home is gone, and Tau Ceti is our best shot now. Earth was already on a tough situation. Procyon arrived when society was already collapsed. We were on the Centuries of Silence, energy was the most scarse thing on a Post-Petrollium world. I never knew that humans had space ships until I saw them crashing on the ground. Destroying my city, during combat with a flying creature.

Three races are having constants encounters while cruising the Milky Way. The control of some of the routes was key for the survival and development of them.

The races have adversarial intentions. We can live together all, and in some large cities in the universe we do. But resourses are very scarse.
